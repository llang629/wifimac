# wifimac
For MacOS, a BASH script for setting the wifi MAC address to a random value, thus bypassing time limits in public hotspots.

Place into a file named wifimac.sh, then execute from the terminal command line:
  bash wifimac.sh
Or place into a file named wifimac.command, then execute by double-clicking.

Administrator password required.

MAC address will reset to default hardware value on next computer restart.
